Launching SCM Express with Whirr
================================

Follow these instructions to start a cluster on EC2 running SCM Express.
SCM Express allows you to install, run, and manage a Hadoop cluster.

This method uses Whirr to start a cluster with
 * one node running the SCM Admin Console,
 * one node for running CDH client programs (e.g. to launch MapReduce jobs), and
 * a user-selectable number of nodes for the Hadoop cluster itself

Once Whirr has started the cluster, you use SCM Express in the usual way.
 
Note that you can omit the CDH client node if you want to run programs entirely
from Hue.

It is not currently possible to launch Hadoop programs from your local machine
that use the cluster, due to the way SCM manages host addresses. To workaround
this limitation it is recommended that you start a CDH client node in the cloud
to run programs from.

1. Install Whirr
================

Run the following commands from you local machine.

Set your AWS credentials as environment variables:

% export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
% export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...

Download and install Whirr:

% curl -O http://www.apache.org/dist/incubator/whirr/whirr-0.5.0-incubating/whirr-0.5.0-incubating.tar.gz
% tar zxf whirr-0.5.0-incubating.tar.gz
% export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)/whirr-0.5.0-incubating/bin

Create a password-less SSH keypair for Whirr to use:

% ssh-keygen -t rsa -P '' -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_scm

2. Launch an SCM Cluster
========================

The following command will start a cluster with 5 Hadoop nodes. To change this
number edit the scm-ec2.properties file. Edit the same file if you don't want to
launch a CDH client node.

% whirr launch-cluster --config scm-ec2.properties

Whirr will report progress to the console as it runs. The command will exit when
the cluster is ready to be used.

3. Configure the Hadoop cluster
===============================

The next step is to run the SCM Admin Console to install and configure Hadoop,
using the instructions at

https://ccp.cloudera.com/display/CDHDOC/Installing+CDH3+with+Service+and+Configuration+Manager+Express+Edition

The output of the Whirr command includes settings for the cluster hosts
and the authentication method to be used while running the SCM Admin Console.

4. Use the cluster
==================

Once the Hadoop cluster is up and running you can use it via Hue (the URL
is printed by the launch cluster command), or from the CDH client machine. In
the latter case, copy the configuration files from the SCM Admin Console to the
CDH client machine using the SCM instructions.

5. Shutdown the cluster
=======================

Finally, when you want to shutdown the cluster, run the following command. Note
that all data and state stored on the cluster will be lost.

% whirr destroy-cluster --config scm-ec2.properties
